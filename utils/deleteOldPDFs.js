/*
The `deleteOldPDFsFromFolder` function is an asynchronous function designed to
delete PDF files from a specified folder if they were not created on the current
day. It begins by attempting to read the contents of the folder using the
`readdir` function from the `fs/promises` module, which returns a list of file
names in the folder. The function then gets the current date in the `YYYY-MM-DD`
format.

Next, the function iterates over each file in the folder. For each file, it
constructs the full file path using the `join` function from the `path` module.
It then retrieves the file's statistics using the `stat` function, which
provides metadata about the file, including its modification time (`mtime`). The
modification time is converted to the `YYYY-MM-DD` format to compare it with the
current date.

If the file's creation date does not match the current date, the function
deletes the file using the `unlink` function and logs a message indicating that
the file was deleted, including the file name, creation date, and folder path.
If the file was created on the current date, it logs a message indicating that
the file was kept.
